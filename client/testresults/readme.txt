The testing code for frontend (React) components is in the acompanying test folder. The images 'test1'.png and 'test2.png' show that tests for components are passing successfully. The test cases are written using Jest and Enzyme testing frameworks. The file 'test3.png' shows a test case failing for a component. This is not causedby the component not working as the failing test case was to check for rendering and the component renders correctly in practice. This failed test case was caused by the test suite not properly integrating with the state management tool we have used, Redux.
